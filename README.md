# Manage your diabetes better with Glucate
This project is a user-centered mobile app designed to help people with diabetes better manage their blood sugar levels through intuitive tracking and personalized insights. 
Unlike many existing apps, it prioritizes accessibility, ease of use, and affordability.
The app collects firsthand experiences from individuals living with diabetes to ensure its features align with real-world needs. 
It allows users to log their meals, estimate calorie and carbohydrate intake via the Nutritionix API, and visualize trends in their blood sugar, carbs, and calorie consumption. 
Authentication and data storage are securely handled through Firebase.
Currently, the app tracks data for one week, with plans for expansion through fundraising to support advanced features and longer tracking periods. 
Ultimately, this project aims to empower users with a practical, inclusive, and efficient tool for diabetes management and overall health tracking.
